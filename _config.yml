intro: |
    Studying Masters in Computer Science at the University of Colorado at Boulder. One of my major interests is in Privacy and Security of users as they browse online.
    That and a general love for everything Computer Science.
    Previously worked as a part of the loader and network team for Samsung Internet, a Chromium based browser for mobile devices.
    Interested in open source, designing data structures and algorithms, problem solving, design patterns and applying good coding practices to make the world a better place, one line of code at a time.

     <strong>Smart Anti Tracking</strong>: One of my biggest research projects happened when I was working for Samsung's browser team. You know how ad providers online seem to know a little too much about you? We wanted the users of our browsers to have their privacy in their control.
     This project involved everything from data collection, feature engineering, handling class imbalance and training to give me a good idea of how an ML project's lifecycle is. This feature is a part of Samsung Internet Browser if you would like to give it a try - <a target='_blank' href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sec.android.app.sbrowser'>Samsung Internet</a>
     <br><strong>Article Detection on Webpages</strong>: Almost all major browsers on Android have Reader mode -  a mode in which the browser removes extraneous content apart from the main article and presents it to the user. The challenge is in identifying which pages have articles in them.
     This project applied everything I learned in Smart Anti Tracking and we came up with a model that classifies Webpages.
#    <strong>Java</strong>: I am experienced in a variety of Java API’s and frameworks. I have worked with Spring 4, Spring Boot, JPA (Hibernate and EclipseLink) in addition to others. <br/><br/>
#    <strong>Groovy</strong> I have used Groovy as a language in production for ~4 years and I am familiar with many of the languages features (such as writing <a target='_blank' href="https://dzone.com/articles/functional-programming-groovy">Functional Programming style groovy</a>) and quirks (such as <a target="_blank" href="https://dzone.com/articles/groovy-retrospective-an-addendum-memory-usage-perm">memory leak issues</a>). <br/><br/>
#    <strong>Cloud platforms</strong>: I have primarily used AWS for running production apps on the cloud. I have experience setting up, configuring and running applications using a range of AWS offerings, including EC2, RDS, S3, Cogito, <a target="_blank" href="http://automateddeveloper.blogspot.com/2018/05/serverless-with-aws-lambda-scala.html">Lambda</a> and its more recent <a target="_blank" href="http://automateddeveloper.blogspot.com/2018/10/machine-learning-with-aws-scala.html">Machine Learning capabilities</a>.<br/><br/>
#    <strong>Web Development</strong>: Through building web applications, I have also worked with various client side technology, having used jQuery, Bootstrap, LESS, SASS, Backbone/Underscore/Require. More recently I have written React applications (primarily using the Create React App framework, and extending them)<br/><br/>
#    <strong>Development Control</strong>: I have a good knowledge of application life-cycle management and have worked with SVN, Git, Maven, Gradle, Sonar, Jenkins, TeamCity, etc. I have experience with an array of testing tools and technologies.<br/><br/>
#    I have also gained experience and knowledge of other technologies from several side projects and research that I have undertaken in my free time, including Android, a variety of social APIs (Twitter etc) and cloud platforms such as CloudFoundry/OpenShift/AppFog/AWS. <br/><br/>
#    As part of Nerdability, I created, and am now primary contributor to, two Spring projects - <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/robhinds/spring-social-geeklist">Spring-Social-Geeklist</a> and <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/nerdability/spring-social-khan-academy">Spring-Social-Khan-Academy</a>, which provide core integration with those third-party APIs on top of the Spring Social framework. They are both listed as community projects: <a target='_blank' href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-social/">http://projects.spring.io/spring-social/</a>. <br/><br/>
#    I write a blog covering technical and opinion articles that can be found here: <a target='_blank' href="http://automateddeveloper.blogspot.com/">automateddeveloper.blogspot.com</a> (I am also a <a target='_blank' href="https://dzone.com/users/899489/rhinds.html">DZone MVB</a>)
